#Initial Set Up

Please read before you git clone!!

## Directions

1. Install Angular CLI at the root folder
Link: [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/)
Note: If you are getting "permission denied" after using `npm install -g @angular/cli`, use `sudo npm install -g @angular/cli`
2. `npm install` to ensure you install all the node packages (if there's any)


## Starting Dev Environment

Use `ng serve` in the command line to run. It will run on `localhost:4200`

That's it!
